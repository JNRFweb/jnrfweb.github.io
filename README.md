        <p> Greece is a great place to visit with many different attractions. Greece is a little coastal European country out on a peninsula in the mediteranian sea. It is best known for it's gorgeous views of the ocean. A great musical, <strong>Mamma Mia</strong>, also took place there. </p>

       Greece has many tourist attractions. It is a very popular vacation spot for many people. With that being said here are a few of the reasons I think you should visit Greece. 
       <li>One of the biggest attractions is their <strong> beaches </strong> and views of the <strong> ocean </strong>. Since Greece is a seaside country they are often associated with the ocean, and they do not disapoint.</li> <br>
       
       <li> Greece is also very well known for it's <strong> history </strong> and <strong> ruins </strong>. If you are a historian or are just interested in history in general, I would highly suggest you visit some of the incredible ancient ruins that Greece has to offer.</li><br>
